## Description:

The purpose of this project is to create a webpage with multiple useful code snippets. I opted to use just HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to do this as a "back to basics" exercise.

## Instructions

1. Follow this <a href="https://thehebi.github.io/css-snippets/">link</a> to navigate to the site.
2. The four buttons alternate the content visible on the page
3. The page loads with CSS snippets visible
4. Click on the `Bootstrap` button to view Bootstrap Snippets
5. Click on the `JavaScript` button to view JavaScript Snippets
6. Click on the `Algorithims` button to view some common JavaScript algorithim snippets
7. Click on the `Copy Snippet` button to save the snippet to your clipboard
8. On smaller screens there is a `Go To Top` button that will scroll you back to the top of the page
